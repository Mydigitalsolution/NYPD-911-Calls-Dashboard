🚨 Project Complete: NYPD 911 Calls Dashboard 🚨

My team and I analyzed 2023–2024 NYPD 911 calls to uncover patterns and improve emergency response.

Key findings:

93% of calls are non-criminal, straining police resources

The Bronx has the highest workload and longest handling times

Predictable hourly and seasonal patterns enable smarter staffing

We delivered an interactive Tableau dashboard and actionable recommendations to reduce burnout, optimize response, and guide public safety funding.
